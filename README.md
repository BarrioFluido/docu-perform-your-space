## Pipeline 

### 1. Gather more info:

- Look for ongoing reasearch in Peru to contribute to - Jesenia 

Cayetano Heredia´s University research on trans population.
Recommended https://www.unicxs.org/ 

- Interview with lgtbq+ colectives in Perú who might be interested - Jesenia and Fabiola
Gianna Camacho, a trans activist from Con empatía NGO (https://www.facebook.com/conempatiaperu/).

- Mapping resources with the communities for the pilot worshop - Jesenia

From the convesation with Con empatia Perú, which is a transfeminine NGO:

- The cellphones they have are android, low and medium range.
- They don't have access to a pc or laptop at home.
- Their access to internet is very limited, they usually charge their line to use FB and wsp for 30 days with 500 megabytes every week.
- They will have access to wifi and two pcs in one session that the NGO is organizing.
- This session is expected to have 10 members of the transfeminine community.
- The person in charge of the session, Gianna, told me that this community is much more receptive if the one person leading the activity is someone their recognise as part of their community. so this guide is mostly for Gianna to lead the session. 
 
### 2. Creation of guidelines:

- Photogrametry guide - Aubrey 
- Runway ML guide - Jesenia 
- Performative guide? - who? - a curator? - an artist? a educator? a community leader?

### 3. Execution of first guide

- Actively looking for communities who might be interested in using the guide on a specific workshop that they will organize with their communities.
- Create the metric tools to use before and after the use of this guide in the workshops, we might need help from a psychologist. (Zaida?)
- Find the best communication medium for the communities to access the guide. With less use of the internet the better.
